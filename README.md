# DSSTORE2 - Self-destructible SSTORE2

DSSTORE2 is a variation of solmate's [SSTORE2](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SSTORE2.sol) with added selfdestruct functionality stolen from [SSTORE3](https://github.com/ZeframLou/sstore2/blob/master/contracts/SSTORE3.sol) and inspired by [this](https://zefram.xyz/posts/how-i-almost-cheesed-the-evm/)

this is just for fun, as much as i'd love to abuse it. you probably don't want to rely on selfdestruct.
