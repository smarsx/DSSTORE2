# DSSTORE2 - Self-destructible SSTORE2
DSSTORE2 is a variation of solmate's [SSTORE2](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/main/src/utils/SSTORE2.sol) with added selfdestruct functionality stolen from [SSTORE3](https://github.com/ZeframLou/sstore2/blob/master/contracts/SSTORE3.sol) and inspired by [this](https://zefram.xyz/posts/how-i-almost-cheesed-the-evm/)

This is just for fun, as much as I'd love to abuse it :) before using read [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4758), [this](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4760), and [this](https://hackmd.io/@vbuterin/selfdestruct).
